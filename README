This is a rewrite, from the ground up, of Banana Mu-client, using libevent2.

It is single threaded, and somewhat more solid than banana-muclient. Also
supports templates, making it a bit more dynamic in usage.

To compile:

1) If iconv is not available on your system or is incompatible:
$ make iconv

2) If libevent2 is not available on your system or is incompatible:
$ make libevent2

3) Compile server
$ make

4) Run it!
